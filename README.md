My personal repository

😁Hello! I'm Isaac Escobar Volkmar, an Electromechanical Engineering student at the Instituto Tecnológico Metropolitano.

I'm passionate about learning, and recently I've become interested in programming. My goal is to build a solid foundation in programming and to have a place where I can share my progress and projects.

🤘It's a pleasure to connect, and if I can help with anything, please feel free to reach out!
